# Multi-level-Neural-Network

[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

This notebook implmenets a multi-layer neural network using tensorflow 2.0 without using keras. This model can use only 3 types of activation functions, 'Relu' , 'sigmoid' and 'linear'.

#### Multinn.py :- This is implements multi level neural network.
#### test_multinn.py :- This is the test script which uses the multi level neural network to test if it is working properly.

#### To run the test case:-
```python
pytest -q test_multinn.py  
```
